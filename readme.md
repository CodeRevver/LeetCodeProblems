# Algorithms

Remember a lot of the interviews want you to go throught he sorts/search algorithms.  I don't think using the Linq utility methods etc is going to be good enough for some of the big companies.  Then again, I may never apply to them....


It's interesting to know though so maybe if you want to get the most optimal solutions you'll need to understand some of these algorithms inside out.

- I should be able to write quicksort from scratch
- Binary search

Haven't done this stuff in a long time and never used it in the job...
